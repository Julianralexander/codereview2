## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Extract the Git Repo_
* _Clone into your home directory_

* _Run and Enjoy_


## Known Bugs

_{When you return results on the quiz that don't follow the linear points method (ie trying to go back to 200 if you already have 500) it won't adjust your result, but it will adjust it if you ADD points instead.}_
